# Work Day Scheduler Using Third Party API

## Description

The purpose of this application is to utulize JQUERY and Dayjs to create an interactive schedule planner. 

The most difficult part of this application is utilizing the unique id in each section to create a working code that does not require repetitive copy and pasting. It has been solved by utilizing for loops and using valid variables. 

## Installation

Please run this on a browser (Google Chrome preferred)

## Usage

This application serves to provide a daily planner for the user. The planner contains a list of typical working day hours where users can input their own event into each hour. If the user wishes to save their event, they can simply press the save icon to the right and it will be saved in their local storage until the user decides to either overwrite the event with new information or delete the input and save as an empty slot. The hour will be color coded according to whether it is in the past, present, or future. The user can utilize it to keep track of their events as the day goes by.
